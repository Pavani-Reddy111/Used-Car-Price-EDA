## ðŸ“Š Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Analysis
- Distribution of car prices
- Price vs year, mileage, brand, fuel type
- Correlation heatmap
- Outlier treatment

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `data/`: Dataset
- `notebooks/`: EDA notebook
- `visuals/`: Exported plots
- `README.md`: Project overview
